Iâ€™ve returned to advR2 more than any other for my day-to-day activities as an R developer, and after working through each of the exercises, then reading how others had solved them, I decided some of my solutions differed enough to warrant putting them into a book.\nI highly recommend the Advanced R Solutions by Malte Grosser, Henning Bumann, and Hadley Wickham. Indrajeet Patil also has a solutions manual worth reading for alternative approaches."
