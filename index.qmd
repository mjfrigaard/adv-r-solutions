# Another version? {.unnumbered}

This is yet another version of the solutions to [Advanced R, 2nd edition](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) (`advR2`). I've returned to `advR2` more than any other for my day-to-day activities as an R developer, and after working through each of the exercises, then reading how others had  solved them, I decided some of my solutions differed enough to warrant putting them into a book. 

I highly recommend the [Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/) by Malte Grosser, Henning Bumann, and Hadley Wickham. Indrajeet Patil also has a [solutions manual](https://bookdown.org/IndrajeetPatil/Advanced-R-exercises/) worth reading for alternative approaches.
